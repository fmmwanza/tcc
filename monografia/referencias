*Title: simulation of ultrasound from CT


*Proposition:

simulation of ultrasound from CT,
which is realistic enough to allow for a stable registration, yet is
computationally efficient at the same time. This has the added ben-
efit that the simulation can be used by physicians or sonographers
during planning, to get a feeling for the accessibility and optimal
orientations even before the ultrasound exam, or the ultrasound-
guided intervention. Furthermore, a novel similarity measure is
developed, which is invariant to missing simulation details, yield-
ing smooth properties and a global maximum at the correct align-
ment.


*Desavantagem da ultrassom

A qualidade da imagem é péssima devido aos efeitos do ruído conhecido como ruído do speckle.

[Automatic CT-ultrasound registration for diagnostic imaging
and image-guided intervention, Wolfgang Wein a,*, Shelby Brunke b, Ali Khamene a, Matthew R. Callstrom c, Nassir Navab d] =>

US imaging has several limiting factors that affect the
use of this methodology for lesional identification and for its use as
a guidance method. These factors include: 
(1) image acquisition is
user dependent, 
(2) the field of view is limited, 
(3) US images are typically acquired off true axial, sagittal, or coronal planes with
resultant difficulty correlating with these other cross-sectional
imaging methods, 
(4) lesional identification can be difficult due
to its echogenicity relative to the organ that is interrogated, and
(5) the quality of the imaging is affected by the physical character-
istics of the patient and overlying structures such as ribs, subcuta-
neous fat, and normal gas-containing structures. In this context,
the fusion of CT and ultrasound can improve the diagnostic value
to an extent beyond the ‘‘sum” of the individual modalities, poten-
tially sparing an invasive biopsy, where a tissue sample for further
pathological examination is obtained.
